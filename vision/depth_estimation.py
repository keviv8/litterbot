Depth Estimation Module

This module is responsible for estimating the depth of each pixel in the video feed.
Depth estimation can be useful for understanding the 3D structure of the scene, which
can help in planning how to navigate the environment and pick up objects.

Functions:
    estimate_depth(video_feed):
        Estimates the depth of each pixel in the given video feed. Returns a depth map
        where each pixel's value corresponds to its estimated depth.
