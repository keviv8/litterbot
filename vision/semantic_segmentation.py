Semantic Segmentation Module

This module is responsible for performing semantic segmentation on the video feed.
Semantic segmentation is the task of classifying each pixel in an image to a specific
class, which can be useful for understanding the scene at a more detailed level than
object detection. For example, it can be used to identify the boundaries of roads,
sidewalks, and other areas where litter might be found.

Functions:
    perform_segmentation(video_feed):
        Performs semantic segmentation on the given video feed. Returns a segmented image
        where each pixel is labeled with its corresponding class.
